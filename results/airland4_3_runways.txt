=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland4
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 3
Objective value: 840.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 2 aircraft (20.0%)
Runway 2: 5 aircraft (50.0%)
Runway 3: 3 aircraft (30.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 99999

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Landed on time
Aircraft 3: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 4: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 5: Landed on time
Aircraft 6: Late by 100 units (penalty: 800.0)
Aircraft 7: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 8: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 9: Landed on time
Aircraft 10: Landed on time

Summary:
Early landings: 2 (20.0%)
On-time landings: 5 (50.0%)
Late landings: 3 (30.0%)
Total early penalty: 20.0
Total late penalty: 820.0
Total penalty: 840.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 1 and 6 is 100 but should be at least 99999
Violation: Separation between aircraft 2 and 3 is 13 but should be at least 15
Violation: Separation between aircraft 5 and 7 is 13 but should be at least 99999
Violation: Separation between aircraft 10 and 3 is 13 but should be at least 15
