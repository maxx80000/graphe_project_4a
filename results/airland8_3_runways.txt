=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland8
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 3
Objective value: 140.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 4 aircraft (40.0%)
Runway 2: 4 aircraft (40.0%)
Runway 3: 2 aircraft (20.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 157

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Landed on time
Aircraft 3: Landed on time
Aircraft 4: Landed on time
Aircraft 5: Late by 8 units (penalty: 120.0)
Aircraft 6: Landed on time
Aircraft 7: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 8: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 9: Landed on time
Aircraft 10: Landed on time

Summary:
Early landings: 1 (10.0%)
On-time landings: 7 (70.0%)
Late landings: 2 (20.0%)
Total early penalty: 10.0
Total late penalty: 130.0
Total penalty: 140.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 4 and 2 is 5 but should be at least 15
Violation: Separation between aircraft 6 and 3 is 12 but should be at least 108
Violation: Separation between aircraft 9 and 3 is 7 but should be at least 8
