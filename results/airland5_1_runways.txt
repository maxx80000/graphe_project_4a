=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland5
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 1
Objective value: 107.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 10 aircraft (100.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 99999

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Landed on time
Aircraft 3: Late by 8 units (penalty: 8.0)
Aircraft 4: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 5: Landed on time
Aircraft 6: Late by 8 units (penalty: 24.0)
Aircraft 7: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 8: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 9: Landed on time
Aircraft 10: Late by 3 units (penalty: 45.0)

Summary:
Early landings: 1 (10.0%)
On-time landings: 4 (40.0%)
Late landings: 5 (50.0%)
Total early penalty: 10.0
Total late penalty: 97.0
Total penalty: 107.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 3 and 7 is 2 but should be at least 3
Violation: Separation between aircraft 5 and 7 is 20 but should be at least 99999
Violation: Separation between aircraft 6 and 1 is 4 but should be at least 8
Violation: Separation between aircraft 6 and 5 is 4 but should be at least 8
Violation: Separation between aircraft 8 and 4 is 125 but should be at least 529
