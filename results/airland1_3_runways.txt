=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland1
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 3
Objective value: 54.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 4 aircraft (40.0%)
Runway 2: 3 aircraft (30.0%)
Runway 3: 3 aircraft (30.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 99999

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 3: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 4: Landed on time
Aircraft 5: Early by 7 units (penalty: 7.0)
Aircraft 6: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 7: Landed on time
Aircraft 8: Early by 7 units (penalty: 7.0)
Aircraft 9: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 10: Landed on time

Summary:
Early landings: 5 (50.0%)
On-time landings: 4 (40.0%)
Late landings: 1 (10.0%)
Total early penalty: 44.0
Total late penalty: 10.0
Total penalty: 54.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 8 and 2 is 24 but should be at least 124
