=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland1
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 1
Objective value: 818.0
Solve time: 0.001 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 10 aircraft (100.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 100095

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 3: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 4: Landed on time
Aircraft 5: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 6: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 7: Late by 96 units (penalty: 768.0)
Aircraft 8: Landed on time
Aircraft 9: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 10: Landed on time

Summary:
Early landings: 3 (30.0%)
On-time landings: 4 (40.0%)
Late landings: 3 (30.0%)
Total early penalty: 30.0
Total late penalty: 788.0
Total penalty: 818.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 8 and 2 is 17 but should be at least 124
Violation: Separation between aircraft 10 and 1 is 7 but should be at least 8
