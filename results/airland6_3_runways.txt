=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland6
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 3
Objective value: 17040.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 4 aircraft (40.0%)
Runway 2: 4 aircraft (40.0%)
Runway 3: 2 aircraft (20.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 200

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Landed on time
Aircraft 3: Landed on time
Aircraft 4: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 5: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 6: Landed on time
Aircraft 7: Late by 85 units (penalty: 17000.0)
Aircraft 8: Landed on time
Aircraft 9: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 10: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)

Summary:
Early landings: 4 (40.0%)
On-time landings: 5 (50.0%)
Late landings: 1 (10.0%)
Total early penalty: 40.0
Total late penalty: 17000.0
Total penalty: 17040.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 3 and 7 is 85 but should be at least 110
Violation: Separation between aircraft 5 and 3 is 17 but should be at least 635
Violation: Separation between aircraft 6 and 7 is 85 but should be at least 200
