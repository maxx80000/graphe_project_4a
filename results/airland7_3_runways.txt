=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland7
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 3
Objective value: 39820.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 3 aircraft (30.0%)
Runway 2: 2 aircraft (20.0%)
Runway 3: 5 aircraft (50.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 300

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Landed on time
Aircraft 3: Late by 96 units (penalty: 19200.0)
Aircraft 4: Late by 100 units (penalty: 20000.0)
Aircraft 5: Landed on time
Aircraft 6: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 7: Early by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 8: Landed on time
Aircraft 9: Landed on time
Aircraft 10: Late by 3 units (penalty: 600.0)

Summary:
Early landings: 2 (20.0%)
On-time landings: 5 (50.0%)
Late landings: 3 (30.0%)
Total early penalty: 20.0
Total late penalty: 39800.0
Total penalty: 39820.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 2 and 4 is 100 but should be at least 200
