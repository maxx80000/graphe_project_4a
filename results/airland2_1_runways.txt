=== Solution Analysis ===
Problem: Problem 1: Minimizing Weighted Delay (Heuristic)
Instance: airland2
Number of aircraft: 10
Number of runways: 1
Objective value: 292.0
Solve time: 0.0 seconds

Runway utilization:
Runway 1: 10 aircraft (100.0%)

Makespan (completion time of last aircraft): 100014

Deviations from target times:
Aircraft 1: Landed on time
Aircraft 2: Landed on time
Aircraft 3: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 4: Landed on time
Aircraft 5: Late by 8 units (penalty: 24.0)
Aircraft 6: Late by 10 units (penalty: 10.0)
Aircraft 7: Late by 15 units (penalty: 120.0)
Aircraft 8: Late by 8 units (penalty: 120.0)
Aircraft 9: Late by 8 units (penalty: 8.0)
Aircraft 10: Landed on time

Summary:
Early landings: 0 (0.0%)
On-time landings: 4 (40.0%)
Late landings: 6 (60.0%)
Total early penalty: 0.0
Total late penalty: 292.0
Total penalty: 292.0

Separation time check:
Violation: Separation between aircraft 1 and 6 is 89 but should be at least 99999
Violation: Separation between aircraft 2 and 4 is 12 but should be at least 15
